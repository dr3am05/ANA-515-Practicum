# ANA-515-Practicum

# For this practicum, I will be using the NYC GT data which comes from NYC parents reporting their kidsâ€™ scores on the gifted and talented exam, as well as school preferences. There are two datafiles which I combined and merged before cleaning the data.

# I have included comments in the R code which helps to understand the cleaning process. Graphs are also created to better visualize the data. There are several columns that lacked data and clarity so they were not being used.

# 2/12 - Upload copies of the original datasets
# 2/26 - Upload cleaned dataset "G&T_Results_Cleaned.csv"
# 2/26 - Upload R code for practicum assignment
